# Decentralized Energy Marketplace

## Overview
The Decentralized Energy Marketplace addresses the inefficiencies and lack of transparency in traditional energy markets by providing a decentralized platform for trading energy tokens. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, it leverages Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time energy prices, ensuring transparency and reliability in transactions. Users can register, create, list, and purchase energy tokens securely and efficiently through this decentralized platform.

## Problem
Traditional energy markets suffer from centralization, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies. Energy trading often involves intermediaries, leading to higher costs and slower transaction times. Additionally, pricing information may not be readily available or trustworthy, hindering fair market participation.

## Solution
The Decentralized Energy Marketplace offers a solution by providing a transparent, efficient, and decentralized platform for energy token trading. By leveraging blockchain technology and Chainlink oracles, it ensures real-time and reliable pricing information. Users can register, create, list, and purchase energy tokens securely, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. This platform fosters a decentralized energy ecosystem, promoting fair market participation and efficiency.

## Features
- **Registration**: Users can register on the platform by providing their wallet address and a username.
- **Energy Token Creation**: Energy producers can create energy tokens representing their energy production.
- **Token Listing**: Owners of energy tokens can list them for sale, specifying the price.
- **Token Purchase**: Users can buy energy tokens listed for sale by transferring the specified amount of Ether.
- **Price Oracle Integration**: The contract integrates with Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time energy prices.
- **Event Logging**: Events are emitted for token listing and purchase, providing transparency and auditability.

## Smart Contract Structure
- **User Struct**: Represents a user, containing fields for wallet address and username.
- **EnergyToken Struct**: Represents an energy token, containing fields for token ID, owner address, amount, and price.
- **Mappings**: Maps user addresses to user structs and token IDs to energy token structs.
- **Events**: Emits events for token listing and purchase.
- **Constructor**: Initializes the Chainlink oracle address.
- **Registration and Profile Management**: Functions for user registration and profile management.
- **Token Creation, Listing, and Purchase**: Functions for creating, listing, and purchasing energy tokens.
- **Fallback Function**: Fallback function to receive Ether.

## Deployment
The contract can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Ensure that the Chainlink oracle address is provided during deployment to enable price feed integration.

## Conclusion
The Decentralized Energy Marketplace offers a solution to the challenges faced by traditional energy markets. By providing a transparent, efficient, and decentralized platform for energy token trading, it promotes fair market participation, reduces transaction costs, and fosters a decentralized energy ecosystem.
